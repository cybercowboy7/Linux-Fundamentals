Security mechanism in linux systems that allow the sys admin to control which services are allowed 
access to the system.

- /etc/hosts.allow
- /etc/hosts.deny

Order of the rules in the files is important. First rule that matches the requested service and host is
the one that will be applied.

TCP wrappers are not a replacement for a firewall as they are limited by the fact that they can only control
access to services and not to ports.
