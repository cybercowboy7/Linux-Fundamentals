XServer

    - User-side part of the X Window System network protocol (X11/ X)
    - X11 consists of a collection of protocols and applications that allow us to call application windows on 
displays in a graphical user interface
    - X server are typcally in ports ranging from TCP6001-6009
    - Can be used to access other computers
    - Significant disadvantage is the unencrypted data transmission. Can overcome through using tunneling in SSH
      - To do this, we have to allow X11 forwarding in the SSH configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) on the
    server that provides the application by changing this option to yes.
    - Vulnerabilities with X11: CVE-2017-2624, CVE-2017-2625, and CVE-2017-2626.


XDMCP

    - X Display Manager Control Protocol is used by X Display Manager for communication through UDP port 177 between
X terminals and UNIX/Linux OSs.
    - Insecure protocol
    - Can be expploited through MITM


VNC

    - Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote sharing system based on the RFB protocol that allows users to control
a computer remotely. 
    - Users can view and interact with a desktop environment remotely over a network connection
    - Most common protocol for remote access
    - Uses encryption
    - Traditionally, VNC listens on TCP port 5900 and offers display 0
    - Tool sfor setting up:
      - TigerVNC
      - TightVNC
      - RealVNC
      - UltraVNC


TigerVNC Installation

    sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies tigervnc-standalone-server -y
    vncpasswd

    - During installation, a hidden folder is created in the home directory called .vnc. Then, we have to create two additional 
files, xstartup and config. The xstartup determines how the VNC session is created in connection with the display manager, and 
the config determines its settings.
