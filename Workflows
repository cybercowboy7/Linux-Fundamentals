  - Common navigation commands
      - pwd
      - ls
      - ls -l (lists it vertically)
      - ls -la (list all, even hidden directories)
      - ls -li (Display file inodes)

  - Working with Files and Directories
      - vim
      - nano
      - touch <name>
      - mkdir <name>
        -p : add a parent directory
      - tree .
      - mv : move and also rename files and directories
        - mv <file/directory> <renamed file/directory>
      - cp

  - Editing Files
      Nano
          - "^" stands for [CTRL} key. 

      VIM
          - Six modes 
            - Normal : All inputs are considered commands. 
            - Insert : All entered characters are inserted into the buffer
            - Visual : Mark a contiguous part of the text. Can then edit anyway you like or replace etc
            - Command : Allows single-line commands at the bottom of the editor.
            - Replace : Newly entered text will overwrite existing characters unless there are no more old characters
            - Ex : Can execute multiple commands sequentially without returning to Normal Mode after each command

  - Find Files and Directories
      - which
          - Returns the path to the file or link that should be executed. Allows us to determine if specific programs
like cURL, netcat wget, python, gcc, are available on the operating system.
          - If program does not exist, no results will be displayed.


      - find
          - Find files and folders. Can filter results. 
          - find <location> <options>
          - OPTIONS
              -type f
                  Define the type of the searched object. 
              -name *.conf
                  indicate the name of the file we are looking for. *.conf stands for all files with the .conf extension
              -user root
                  This option filters all files whose owner is the root user
              -size +20k
                  Filter all located files and specify that we only want to see the files that are larger than 20Kb
                  Can utilize -size +25k -size -28k to find files that are between 25k and 28k in size
              -newermt 2020-02-02
                  Set the date. Only files newer than the specified date will be presented
              -exec ls -al {} \;
                  Executes the specified command, using the curly brackets as placeholders for each result. The backslash
              escapes the next character from being interpreted by the shell because otherwise, the semicolon would 
              2>/dev/null
                  STDERR redirection to the 'null device'. This redirection ensures that no errors are displayed in the terminal. This redirection must 
              not be an option of the 'find' command.

      - locate
          - Quicker way to search through the systen
          - Works with a local DB that contains all information about existing files ad folders. 
          - Update the DB with the 'sudo updatedb' command.

    - File Descriptors and Redirections
        - FD is an indicator of connection maintained by the kernel to perform I/O operations. Windows based systems call it filehandle.
        - It is the connection (generally to a file) from the OS to perform I/O operations 
        - First 3 file descriptors in Linux are:

            - DATA STREAM FOR INPUT
                STDIN - 0

            - DATA STREAM FOR OUTPUT
                STDOUT - 1
                EXAMPLE:
                  find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null > results.txt
                    - This will pipe all errors to /dev/null while piping the remaining STDOUT to the results.txt file.
                  find /etc/ -name shadow 2> stderr.txt 1> stdout.txt  
                    - This will pipe STDERR to stderr.txt and STDOUT to stdout.txt

            - DATA STREAM FOR OUTPUT THAT RELATES TO AN ERROR OCCURRING
                STDERR - 2
                EXAMPLE:
                  find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null
                    - This will pipe all data streams related to errors to the /dev/null file to ensure a clean output

        - REDIRECT STDIN
            "from where" and "where to"
                cat < stdout.txt
                  - This uses the cat command to use the contents of the file stdout.txt as STDIN

        - REDIRECT STDOUT AND APPEND TO A FILE
            (>) is used to redirect STDOUT, a new file is automatically created if it does not already exist. If the file exists, it will
          be overwritten without asking for confirmation.

            (>>) This is used to append STDOUT to our existing file.

        - REDIRECT STADIN STREAM TO A FILE
            (<<) used to add our standard input through a stream. Can use End of File Function of a linux system
          this defines the input's end. 
              cat << EOF > stream.txt
                - Use the cat command to read our streaming input through the stream and direct it to a file called "stream.txt"

        - PIPES
            - Pipes are another way to redirect STDOUT
            - Grep is used to filter STDOUT according to the pattern we define.
            EXAMPLE:
                find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd
                  - Use the find command to search for all files in the /etc/ directory with a .conf extension
                  - any errors are redirected to the null device
                  - using grep we filter out the results to only specify that only the lines containing the pattern systemd should be displayed

            EXAMPLE2:
                
                find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd | wc -l 
                  - Same as above function
                  - We are going to redirect the output of the grepped information to the wc tool in order to display the total number of obtained results











          - Can utilize vimtutor to practive and get familiar with the editor : Command mode, :Tutor
