Iptables

- Flexible set of rules for filtering network based traffic based on various criteria such as source
and destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, and more.




Components of Iptables:

- Tables: Used to organize and categorize firewall rules

- Chains: Used to group a set of firewall rules applied to a specific type of network traffic

- Rules: Define the criteria for filtering network traffic and the actions to take for packets that 
match the criteria

- Matches: Used to match specific criteria for filtering network traffic, such as source or destination
IP addresses, ports, protocols, and more

- Targets: Specify the action for packets that match a specific rule. For example, targets can be used 
to accept, drop, or reject packets or modify the packets in another way.




Tables:

Table Name 	Description 	Built-in Chains
filter 	    Used to filter network traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. 	      INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD
nat 	      Used to modify the source or destination IP addresses of network packets. 	      PREROUTING, POSTROUTING
mangle 	    Used to modify the header fields of network packets. 	      PREROUTING, OUTPUT, INPUT, FORWARD, POSTROUTING




Chains:

Organize rules that define how network traffic should be filtered or modified. 
Two types of chains in iptables:
    - Built-in chains: pre-defined and auto created when a table is created. Each table has a different
set of built-in chains
    - User-defined chains: simplify rule management by grouping firewall rules based on specific criteria,
such as source IP address, dest. port, or protocol.






Match Name 	Description
-p or --protocol 	Specifies the protocol to match (e.g. tcp, udp, icmp)
--dport 	Specifies the destination port to match
--sport 	Specifies the source port to match
-s or --source 	Specifies the source IP address to match
-d or --destination 	Specifies the destination IP address to match
-m state 	Matches the state of a connection (e.g. NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED)
-m multiport 	Matches multiple ports or port ranges
-m tcp 	Matches TCP packets and includes additional TCP-specific options
-m udp 	Matches UDP packets and includes additional UDP-specific options
-m string 	Matches packets that contain a specific string
-m limit 	Matches packets at a specified rate limit
-m conntrack 	Matches packets based on their connection tracking information
-m mark 	Matches packets based on their Netfilter mark value
-m mac 	Matches packets based on their MAC address
-m iprange 	Matches packets based on a range of IP addresses
