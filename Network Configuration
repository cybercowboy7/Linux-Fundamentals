Configuring Network Interfaces

    - utilize ifconfig or ip commands to manage network interfaces

    - Activate Network Interface
      sudo ifconfig eth0 up     #OR
      sudo ip link set eth0 up

    - Assign IP Address to an Interface
      sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2

    - Assign a Netmask to an Interface
      sudo ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0

    - Assign the Route to an Interface
      sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1 eth0

    - Editing DNS Settings
      - The system can properly resolve domain names to IP addresses by adding the system's DNS information
      sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf

    - Editing Interfaces
      sudo gedit /etc/netplan/*.yaml 
      - This is for newer versions of ubuntu where you need to use the netplan apply command to apply interface configurations


    - Restarting Network Service
      sudo systemctl restart networking


Network Access Control

    - Discretionary Access Control
      Enables users to manage access to their resources by granting resource owners the responsibility of controlling
      access permissions to their resources.

      Users and groups who own a specific resource can decide who has access to their resources and what actions they 
      are authorized to perform



    - Mandatory Access Control
      Provides more fine grain control over resource access than DAC. Those systems define rules that define rules that 
      determine resource access based on the resource's security level and the user's security level or process requesting
      access. 

      Each resource is assigned a security label that identifies its security level, and each user or process
      is assigned a security clearance that identifies its security level.

      Access to a resource is only granted if the user's or process's security level is equal to or greater than the security 
      level of the resource


    - Role-based Access Control
      Assigns permissions to users based on their roles within an organization. Users are assigned roles based on their job 
      responsibilities or other criteria, and each role is granted a set of permissions that determine the actions they can 
      perform.

      RBAC simplifies the management of access permissions, reduces the risk of errors, and ensures that users can access only 
      the resources necessary to perform their job functions

      RBAC provides a more flexible and scalable approach to managing resource access. In an RBAC system, each user is assigned 
      one or more roles, and each role is assigned a set of permissions that define the user's actions. Resource access is granted 
      based on the user's assigned role rather than their identity or ownership of the resource. RBAC systems are typically used in 
      environments with many users and resources, such as large organizations, government agencies, and financial institutions.


Troubleshooting

    - ping
    - Traceroute
    - Netstat: Displays network connections and their associated ports. 
    - Tcpdump
    - Wireshark
    - Nmap


Hardening

    - SELinux
      MAC system that is built into the Linux kernel. Provides fine-grained access control over system resources and applicaitons.

      Works by enforcing a policy that defines the access controls for each process and file on the system.

      It providers a higher level of security by limiting the da,age that a compromised process can do.


    - AppArmor
      MAC system that provides a similar level of control over system resources and applications, but it works
      slightly different. 

      Implemented as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and uses application profiles to define the resources that an application can access.

      Easier to implement then SELinux but not as granular.


    - TCP wrappers
      Host-based network access control mechanism that can be used to restrict access to network services based on the IP addresses
      of the client system.

      Works by intercepting incoming network requests and comparing the IP address of the client system to the access control
      rules. Useful for limiting access to network services from unauthorized systems.
